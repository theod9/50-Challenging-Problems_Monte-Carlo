This repository contains Jupyter notebooks in which I solve problems from the book **Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability** using Monte Carlo simulations. The solutions are then compared to those derived in the book using analytical methods.
The book can be found [here](https://mbapreponline.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf)
